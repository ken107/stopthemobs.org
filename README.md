Mobs are dangerous, no matter their origin.  Mobs can only form around ideologies.  Free thinkers cannot form mobs because they can't come to an agreement on anything.  Specifically, it requires a certain amount of mindlessness and lack of skepticism for mobs to form.

As soon as a group of people begin to exhibit mob behavior, it needs to be stopped. Allowing a mob to continue to accumulate power, is a recipe for hell.

On this website we attempt to identify the mobs, the ideology that unites them, and their progress.
